## Introduction

Most of you probably know a Czech legendary game Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. Released in 2002, it brought many of us an awesome experience full of action, emotions and realism. It is the game that can't be forgotten, the game that is seen as an example of how games should act like and what the possibilities truly are once passionate people decide to jump into a dream realisation.

As a tribute to our favorite game, we've decided to bring the soul a new skeleton, fully covered by modern tech, so that you can enjoy playing this game even after so many years. The decision to build tools and an engine, which will attempt to re-interpret the memories we've all had in our hearts and minds, to bring the nostalgic feeling back in front of our eyes, we seek to fullfill the ambition to bring the masterpiece and hear the whistles of the past once more.

## Description

We aim to create open-source tools for the game [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(video_game)). The ultimate goal is to recreate the original game engine using Unity, to build up our framework thanks to which we can enjoy playing Mafia once more and also simplify modding process.

## Progress so far

We recommend to visit [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/eBQ4QHX) to be up-to-date about current status. The research on Mafia's native formats takes place [here](https://github.com/OpenMafia/OpenMF/blob/master/Docs/DataFiles.md)

## Disclaimer

We respect copyrights and intelectual property and you need to own the original game with all the game data in order for our tools to be useful to you.
